# band-name-generator

## Objective

- Use JavaScript to make your Band Name Generator work.

- Practice using arrays, functions, and DOM manipulation.

- Style your app using Tailwind CSS.

- Build and deploy a polished mini-project to GitHub Pages.

## The Challenge

You've received some starter code! The Band Name Generator has great structure — now it needs a brain and some flair. This week, you’ll write the logic to randomly generate a band name when a user clicks a button. You'll style it with Tailwind CSS

## Part 1: Setup & Data

Tasks

- Use the provided starter HTML file

- The page already includes two arrays:

const adjectives = ["Funky", "Loud", "Silent", "Electric", "Wicked", "Groovy"];
const nouns = ["Penguins", "Wizards", "Socks", "Robots", "Bananas", "Crows"];
Complete the empty JavaScript functions:

- getAdjective() – return a random adjective from the array

- getNoun() – return a random noun from the array

- generateBandName() – combine them and display in the format:

“The Funky Wizards”

## Part 2: Make It Work

Tasks

- Add a click event listener to the Generate Name button

-When clicked:

- Call generateBandName()

- Display the name in the div id="band-name"

- element

-Use textContent or innerText to update the DOM

## Part 3: Style with Tailwind (Creative Freedom)

Style your app with Tailwind CSS to make it pop!
Install Tailwind: tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/play-cdntailwindcss.com/docs/installation/play-cdn

Use utility classes for:

- Layout (flexbox, spacing, centering)

- Typography (font size, color, boldness)

- Buttons (hover effects, borders, padding)

- Optional: add a fade-in animation or make it mobile-friendly

## Submission Checklist

- Random band names appear when the button is clicked

- Styled using Tailwind CSS

- Project is deployed to GitHub Pages

- You used Git properly (ACP regularly)
